## Business Model
Golos is a dedicated Russian language social media and content platform that rewards users for generating well liked content. Golos is a licensed clone of the Steem.it blockchain designed to cater specifically to the needs of the Russian speaking community.  
Similar to Steem.it, Golos has three internal currencies: one for market trading [Voice, like Steem], one for voting on the platform [Voice Power, like Steem Power], and one with a stable value used to compensate users [Voice Gold, like Steem Dollars]. Voice Gold however is tied to the value of Gold, not the value of the US Dollar.
