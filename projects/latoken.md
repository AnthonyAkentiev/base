## Business Model
LAToken tokenizes and makes tradable fractions of assets ranging from real estate and loans to works of art. Asset owners receive funding by tokenizing their assets and selling them on the LAT marketplace. They sell a fraction of an asset instead of borrowing against it and thus do not incur any interest obligations. At the same time, sellers may continue using assets after the sale without paying any rent. LAToken offers unique opportunities for investors of any size to own fractions of assets previously accessible only by large investors (e.g. real estate, works of art) and thus increase the ROI and diversify portfolios. LAT is the single currency used at the LAT exchange to sell and buy tokenized assets and pay for transactions. The proceeds from the Token Sale of LAT will be used for further platform development, recruiting asset-owners and investors, and product marketing. The wallet with the Token sale proceeds will be managed by a responsible Trustee governed by a decentralized Escrow Board/Board of Directors.
