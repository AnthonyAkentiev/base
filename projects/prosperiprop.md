## Business Model
 The PROPX NanoChain is an Ethereum based blockchain - designed to make fractional investment a reality. The word nano in the name is a metaphor for small transactions, the chain itself is a large, secure system to be built on the MultiChain private blockchain framework. We foresee that it will manage hundreds of thousands of transactions a day managing millions of accounts.
