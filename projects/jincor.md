## Business Model
Jincor is a venture-backed enterprise communication tool aimed at helping employees within an organisation to connect with each other and existing external partners as well as to establish new business relations with companies across the globe and streamline blockchain transactions involving digital assets, contractual and legal procedures via smart contracts. Jincor sees its mission in building a global enteprise platform which interconnects organizations, people within them and assets into a blockchain-powered autonomous ecosystem, while also thriving on security and transparency. Thus challenging inherent complexity and limitations of the dominant institutional designs, our goal is to ultimately empower business communications by reducing the amount of time, effort and money it usually takes to find and establish valuable business connections, expand your market reach and execute transactions.
