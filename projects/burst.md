Burst uses a new algorithm for proof of hdd capacity (POC) mining.  
Miners pre-generate chunks of data known as 'plots' which are then saved to disk.  
The number of plots you store is effectively your mining speed.  
Every block the miner will skim through the saved plots, and come up with an amount of time until it is able to mine a block if another block hasn't yet been found. After reading through the plots is complete, your hardware can idle until the newest block.

Burstcoin was released to the public on 10 August 2014 on bitcointalk.org by the original developer who is known under the alias "Burstcoin". Their real identity is still unknown today. The coin was launched without an initial public offering (IPO) or Premine.[note 2] The genesis block was published on 11 August 2014.[3] Approximately one year later, the main developer "Burstcoin" disappeared without any explanation.

Being an open source project, other members of community then took over the development of Burstcoin. On 11 January 2016, a new forum thread was created on Bitcointalk.org by a senior community member. The core code is still being actively developed by a wide range of contributors from all over the globe.[4]
