## Business Model
 * Smart contract technology enables end-to-end automation of payments, efficient risk model estimation, and semi-automated claims processing, thus substantially lowering operating costs.Investors
 * Lower costs enable insurance solutions for developing markets, low-income businesses, and new product verticals which have been previously unable to obtain insurance. For example, crop insurance for rural farmers in developing countries is an underserved market and a good candidate for further exploration.
 * Digital assets on blockchains create opportunities to structure exposure to insurance products for a much broader range of investors.
 *On most blockchains, transparency is a platform-level feature. All data in a smart contract based system is publicly auditable and can be freely analyzed by third parties. Etherisc will also provide a user friendly, comprehensive frontend displaying the key performance indicators of the system.*
