## Business Model
Vera helps to find qualified employees.

The robot-recruiter reduces the time and labour costs for a large-scale recruitment by 10 times. Vera leads to a reduction in the cost of hiring by 50%. 150+ customers, 60+ thousand qualified responses â€” is what Vera did in only six months. Monthly revenue growth from 50% to 100%, and increase in gross margin of more than 50%.
