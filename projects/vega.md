## Business Model
Vega is a decentralized VC/Crowdfunding platform on Ethereum, encouraging higher market standards and offering the ability for individuals to leverage their own impact in the market without having to take irresponsible levels of risk. Vega also takes ‘decentralization’ to its natural conclusion, by not forcing platform users to rely on a handful of devs to identify and solve every issue in a timely manner, but rather allowing users to immediately fund solutions to problems as they’re identified.
