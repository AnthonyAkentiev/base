## Business Model
The Playkey idea is to create an ecosystem for cloud gaming based on P2P and blockchain technologies featuring: -Dozens of independent owners of powerful computers worldwide (miners) united within a community, and acting as cloud gaming service providers; -A single universal ecosystem cryptocurrency — the PKT token— which will be issued via the ICO; -Unified high standards of cloud gaming service (SLA) set in the form of a miner-gamer smart contract; -A governing and community regulating body — Playkey Foundation, the issuer of the PKT token, responsible for service and ecosystem development.
