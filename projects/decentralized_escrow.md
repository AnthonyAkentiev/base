## Business Model
 - retain ICO market and crowdfunding as the most favorable and effective ways to raise funds in truly useful, innovative projects, shifting thinking model and interaction between people, companies and states. 

- as much as possible exclude from this fundraising area projects that don't even intend to make the final, promised product initially, and those ones who will come to this decision later. 

- enable investors to control their own funds independently. 

- create conditions for decentralized decision-making.
