## Business Model
They use the blockchain to build a fair, transparent, and corrupt-free eSports community, where any talented gamer can get coaching and capital to grow into a pro player. Smart contracts incentivize and remunerate coaches for supporting eSports superstars. And sponsors circumvent gatekeepers to sponsor talented players directly via the blockchain.LEAP tokens will be backed by equity shares in real world companies, giving you information rights, voting rights, and representation in the board of directors. Tokens will also be used as a currency in the LEAP ecosystem. This way token holders might benefit both when more people use LEAP tokens as well as when the value of the underlying real world assets grows.
