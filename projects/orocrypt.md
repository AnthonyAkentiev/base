Orocrypt is a Panamanian-based company that will issue tokenized precious metals. Tokens will be backed by securely stored and audited precious metals, convertible on demand, and easily tradable. Tokens are secured on the Ethereum blockchain and will be compatible with all Ethereum wallets. They can be bought or sold instantly and seamlessly. Orocrypt will launch gold-backed tokens, each representing 30 g of LBMA compliant bullion gold. In the future, we will expand to Silver, Platinum and bespoke tokens.
