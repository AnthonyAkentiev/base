## Business Model
The CHEX Token innovation will directly impact the optimization of established and unestablished commodity and asset exchange frameworks. The superstructure that CHEX in­tends to create is a unification of isolated industry sectors on a common, blockchain-secured platform. The CHEX Token utility serves to establish (1) a transaction medium for exchange between parties and (2) a distributed, immutable ledger record of verifiable asset holdings and physical asset tracking. CHEX Tokens will also be rewarded to power users that supply useful market activity and platform content to subsidize transactions and boost a commodity sector’s ecosystem.
