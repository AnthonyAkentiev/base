## Business Model
MedCredits harnesses the power of the blockchain, Ethereum smart contracts, a P2P network, and smart phones to connect patients and doctors worldwide on a decentralized network. By decentralizing medicine, MedCredits is able to create a free-market system providing more affordable and efficient healthcare than currently available. The first software release 'Hippocrates' is a user-friendly app on the MedCredits platform connecting patients to dermatologists for fast diagnoses at a fraction of the cost.
