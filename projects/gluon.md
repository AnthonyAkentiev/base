## Business Model
Gluon plans to leverage the power of blockchain in giving true meaning to the concept of “internet of things” as far as vehicles are concerned. The project will be applying cutting edge but simple technology to help consumers understand their vehicles. Unlike existing tech products that diagnose the issues in an already faulty vehicle at a workshop, the Gluon platform will be able to forewarn a vehicle owner; this way the vehicle owner gets to reduce the cost of repair and also save time.
