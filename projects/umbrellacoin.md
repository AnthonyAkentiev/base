## Business Model
Umbrella Coin (UMC) is a Decentralized Incurance Platform.
The idea from Umbrella Coin is that if the middle men are no longer present, fees should drop and claim decisions will be made for the correct reasons.
Making UMC holders both the insurers and policyholders results in situation when those who are insured will vote on otherâ€™s claims, essentially deciding if payment should be made.
