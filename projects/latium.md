## Business Model
Latium is decentralized microtasking platform, that allow people looking to have tasks completed to connect directly with those willing to complete the work. 
Payment for tasks completed on the system will be credited in realtime using the Ethereum Blockchain.
The Latium ERC20 token (LAT) will be the established form of payment on the platform, which will create intrinsic value for token
holders as the coins will be purchased by employers in order to create new tasks in the system.
