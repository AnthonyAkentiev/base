## Business Model
Project of Protocol Labs Ltd.
 Decentralized storage network utilizing IPFS for data storage and retrieval and Ethereum for blockchain and smart contracting functionality. The Filecoin network will operate as a decentralized, open marketplace for storage services. The marketplace is structured in much the same way that an asset exchange is: buyers and sellers are anonymously matched based on the price they are willing to execute a deal.
 * Clients: Clients are users of the networkâ€™s cloud storage services. They can be individuals, companies, developers, organizations, or blockchain apps.
* Filecoin miners: Miners contribute storage resources to the network and host client data. Filecoin miners must make a deposit in proportion the amount of storage space they contribute.
The product for sale in the Filecoin marketplace are units of spacetime, a specified quantity of data stored for a specified future amount of time. Clients are matched with miners who can meet their spacetime needs. In turn, miners compete with each other to provide clients with the most spacetime at the lowest prices. This marketplace model distinguishes Filecoin from [Storj](storj.md) which employs a tiered subscription price model, currently a standard in the cloud storage industry.
