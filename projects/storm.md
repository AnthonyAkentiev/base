## Business Model
StorMarket is a decentralized, and secured micro-job marketplace operating on the Ethereum blockchain. StorMarket uses smart contracts, written in Solidity, enforcing systemic integrity; all enforced by the algorithms coded in smart contracts. StorMarket will be completely decentralized without any central points of failure and will operate on peer-to-peer network operations, meaning no one can ever shut it down or manipulate the protocols. All processing for StorMarket will reside on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As such, all transactions are validated, executed, and enforced by a global network of Ethereum nodes.
