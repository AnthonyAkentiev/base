## Business Model
Peerity is an activity network. The Peerity team believes that current social networks and many web applications are fundamentally broken. Despite people being more connected than ever, they nevertheless feel more disconnected and alienated. This is because the existing social networks treat their users not as the customer or partner, but rather as a product. Peerity would like to end "people as product" model by allowing users to own their data as well as rewarding the user for their activity within their communities.
