## Business Model
REIDAO seeks to introduce crypto assets that are backed by a particular real estate in the real world. This will create an exposure towards the real estate market for the crypto assets holders, such as rental income generation and capital appreciation from the underlying property. These crypto assets will follow the ERC20 Token Standard, and will be able to be integrated with other services on the Ethereum blockchain.
