## Business Model
Cash Poker Pro is a poker room with a network structure and a mechanism for fast and confidential money transfers based on the blockchain technology. The mission of this project is to create a decentralized online poker room where users can trust. In today's online casino and poker sites use a centralized random number generator (RNG) , which is influenced from the outside. For example, the owner of the resource can influence on the process and the outcome of the game, have access to the server and the software code. This system causes distrust from users. Cheating with cards or the "bloody hand" in card games is often mentioned. Decentralized system and Blockchain technology can solve this problem.
