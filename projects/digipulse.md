## Business Model
DigiPulse is creating an alternative for the last will in the digital age.Their goal is to ensure that digital assets are not lost and people are able to pass them on to the rightful inheritors, in case of the owner’s death. By this they are tackling the issue of escheatment in the digital domain. Their plan is to set up an infrastructure that will become an industry wide standard for the future generations to come. With the increasing usage of cryptocurrencies the problem of leaving your assets to inheritors is becoming more and more important. Currently none of the digital vaults offer this possibility and the user can’t be sure that the paper wallet will be delivered to the rightful inheritor.
