## Business Model
Monetha is a decentralized trust and reputation solution
working together with mobile payments processing on the
Ethereum blockchain leveraging smart contract technology.  
  
Key features:  
* Universal/Transferable trust and reputation system: Every time a
transaction is made the blockchain will record the time of the transaction, both
receiving and sending wallet addresses, warranty conditions, delivery time, and all
other information that is typically needed to ensure trust of transaction.  
* Mobile payments solution: After simple integration with Monetha, merchants will be able to:
use our decentralized trust and reputation system, accept Ethereum based
tokens, accept mobile payments, and easily convert cryptocurrency to their
local fiat currency.  
* Enabling merchants to reach digital asset economy: By developing Monetha, we
will not only allow merchants to participate in a
trustful decentralized economy, but also reach the growing digital asset
economy through our payment solution.
  
Fee structure:  
1.5% transaction fee for the merchants
