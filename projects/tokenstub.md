## Business Model
TokenStub is a decentralized infrastructure for event ticket sales, which aims to disrupt the $33 billion event ticketing industry.  The ticketing industry is plagued with problems.  Consumers are blocked from the primary market due to the proliferation of sophisticated resellers who use bots to buy up the majority of tickets.  When consumers are able to access the primary market, typically only subpar seats are available – and customers must pay exorbitant fees to secure those seats.  If tickets to an event are sold out, consumers typically turn to the secondary market to source their tickets.  On the secondary market, they also pay high fees and risk fraud due to the lack of transparency. TokenStub’s blockchain-based decentralized ticketing platform provides natural solutions to many of these challenges and promises a fair, efficient and secure marketplace for both buyers and sellers.
