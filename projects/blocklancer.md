## Business Model
Blocklancer is a so called Distributed Autonomous Job Market (DAJ) on the Ethereum platform, our vision of a completely self-regulatory platform for finding jobs and getting projects done. It will change the way freelancing works, both for customers and freelancers, and it will lift the reliability of freelancing to new heights. With this project we want to tackle several issues that are currently prevalent in the freelancing world, including but not reserved to: fake reviews, getting the payment for your work reliably and the uncontrollable influence of a central authority figure. Blocklancer is completely owned by its Token holders. The Token holders settle disputes and earn the fees within the system.
