## Business Model
Kencoin is an industry-specific cryptocurrency, targeting the adult entertainment sector. Their mission is to serve as the standard currency for anonymous, safe transactions in all sex and dating-related purchases. Usersâ€™ desire to preserve absolute privacy creates major hurdles for businesses in the adult sector. Many prospective customers visit websites that fulfill their fantasies, only to drop out of the signup/payment process at the moment the website asks for personal or financial details. Thus, owners of adult websites lose a significant amount of business every day, simply because their users lack a safe, anonymous way to pay for the content they want. Kencoin solves this problem in one stroke, with a completely anonymous cryptocurrency that leverages blockchain technology to provide users with anonymity, privacy and secured transactions, while delivering previously unreachable alpha to adult industry merchants.
