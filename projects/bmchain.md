## Business Model
For the majority of people Blockchain is just an unclear phrase or the name of another bubble. Nevertheless, Blockchain is the thing of the future. At the moment, projects using it don't have ultimate utility for the vast majority of people. This is the main market gap.

Each of us helped someone or a lot of people. We found ourselves useful to other people and received gratitude for this. In some situations we exceeded our customers' expectations, offering more than they expected to get for their money.

The solution created by us allows everyone to say thank you for the benefit received and everyone who deserves it to receive it in the form of tokens (digital asset) to their accounts. The accumulation of tokens and the amount of gratitudes will increase your reputation and thereby will multiply the size of each subsequent gratitude.
