## Business Model
Streamr tokenizes real-time data to enable a new way for machines & people to trade it on a decentralised P2P network. Currently, the valuable data you produce is at the mercy of large corporations. In the Streamr network, itâ€™s yours to use and sell as you wish, and travels through a decentralised peer-to-peer network controlled by no one and incentivized by the DATAcoin token. Streamr provides the infrastructure and tools to create unstoppable real-time data apps, even without writing code.
