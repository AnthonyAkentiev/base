## Business Model
Exscudo is the nextgen financial ecosystem. Its main goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial world and to create a single gateway to the market for common users, traders, investors and financial institutions. Exscudo consists of a Stock exchange, merchant, trading terminals, cards and the Exscudo Channels app – a mobile wallet and messenger. All Exscudo services are connected to the liquidity center via the company’s own blockchain EON - this measure makes them more secure and transparent than existing cryptocurrency exchanges. The EON blockchain platform enables the whole system to be transparent without disclosing bank secrecy.
