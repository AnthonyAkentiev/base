DDF offers investors an opportunity to participate in high growth digital assets such as domain names and crypto currency. The roots of the DDF go back to 2010, when DDF was incorporated as "Domain Developers Fund" in the Cayman Island. DDF holds over 1,350 premium domains such as Swords.com, Audits.com, Exhibitions.com or PR.uk. In 2017, the fund rebrands to "Digital Developers Fund" and raises funds via an ICO to expand its asset allocation.
