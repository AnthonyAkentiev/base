## Business Model
SmartRE is a highly secured, decentralized and democratized platform
whereby US homeowners can liquidate a percentage of their equity in their
homes without accruing debt of any kind. For buyers, the attraction is the ability
to own a piece of the American dream and its associated growth, especially in
high-demand geographies, without the headaches of property management and
maintenance, but with the assurance of a customized insurance policy from
Lloydâ€™s of London. Tokens are used as units that reflect the percentage of the
homes, and are traded and escrowed via smart contracts on the Ethereum
blockchain. SmartRE provides the tools and setup, with the transactions between
the buyers and sellers themselves.
