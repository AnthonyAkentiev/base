## Business Model
The Obsidian Project aims to offer unrivaled private communication by marrying a secure messenger application with a cryptographic coin that enables a decentralised communication network. This provides resilience against attacks on the communication servers by replacing them with decentralised nodes which anyone can host, and thus receive Obsidian coins as compensation. The app is currently in "Public Beta".
