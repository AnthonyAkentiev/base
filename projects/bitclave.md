## Business Model
When it comes to online advertising, businesses are forced to pay exorbitant amounts of money to “middlemen” in order to reach a captive audience for their promotions. BitClave proposes a system in which the intermediaries are eliminated. Instead of paying any “middlemen”, companies automatically make personalized offers directly to consumers who have opted in for the service. In this ecosystem, consumers have control over their own data and can opt into advertising and analytics services by retailers through the use of smart contracts.
