## Business Model
A dedicated virtual reality streaming platform on the blockchain.
Spectiv will be driven by a two token ecosystem, with “Specs” operating as an internal
platform currency and Signal Tokens (Sigs) operating as a decentralized ERC20 token. Sigs
connect attention markets with the Ethereum blockchain to foster growth in the virtual
reality industry. Specs will be used to facilitate functions exclusive to the Spectiv platform, including ad
rewards, tips, and premium content purchases.
