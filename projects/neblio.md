## Business Model
Blockchainâ€™s unique distributed ledger technology is what makes the Neblio Network possible. This decentralized system of securely storing transactions is the future of database technology for global networks. Enterprise applications taking advantage of this technology gain numerous benefits over those using traditional database architectures including transaction immutability, transparency, security, reliability, and decentralization. Despite the maturity of blockchain networks, few applications have taken advantage of the technology due to the difficulty, and cost of integration and maintenance. Unlike legacy blockchain networks, next-generation blockchain networks such as Neblio will fill the huge gap in the enterprise market to simplify the development and deployment of distributed applications that drive business value through blockchain technology.
