## Business Model
Decentralized email system. We believe in user independence: control, privacy and security.
Proemtheus creates independent users by changing how the email works. Direct user-to-user comunication. 
Fully threaded mailbox. Templates, polls, fast answer. Click-and-go automation . Personal cloud storage. Platform for service providers.
There will be three main development areas: 
1. software for individual users (refer to our GIFT section on the website): independent email, personal storage, security. 
For those interested in news and advertising we are considering the introduction of a new way for relating to ads: user states his interests in an ADD CENTER from one side and advertisers from the other side match those interests. The tide will turn in that advertisers will pay fees to reach users and we’ll use some of this funds to reduce user subscription. 
Users will not be fed by default with ads based on their harvested data, but receive adds only if opted to, and based on what they state as their interest – this also increases the chance of buying. 
This model can also function as a news subscription model, pay-per-use for established media or freelancer providers. 
2. platform for service providers & developers. For example it’s like fog computing, Airbnb or Uber maintaining a platform for providers and developers to offer their services. All transactions on the platform will be subject to a fee. 
We intend to introduce a new way of having access to expensive licensed software: pay-per-use not only from individual service providers on the platform but also to established software companies. This option will complete the circle, besides license and subscription, and will be attractive for software companies, news and media companies. 
3. work platform developed for companies (please refer to THE BIG PICTURE section of the website). 
At this moment we choose not to get into much feature or technical details about this work platform besides the information provided on the website. 
The goal is to make available an ALL-IN-ONE – UNIFIED COMMUNICATION & WORK PLATFORM that will eliminate the need for a PC on the desk. 
This branch of the project will be revolutionary for what work environment means: starting with a simple great UI and breakthrough features: just fast answer alone will be awesome and sharply decrease communication volume. 
Never will one need to switch the current window, not even for company specific software. 
Working remote will be as working in the office.
