## Business Model
Global decentralized blockchain-platform, where people and companies can interchange directly to each other. 
Decentralized Roles
Each community member earns money and reputation for useful actions: involving new investor or good borrower, hi-quality scoring, asset management, analytics, insurance etc. 
Decentralized Interchange Rules
At Karma investors give their money directly to borrowers. Community members can offer any loan conditions: with collateral or without it, with interest rate or without it, with mandatory repayment or without it.
Decentralized Location
The ecosystem of thousands of hedge funds and currency exchange risk insurers will be in a competition to create the best option for risk minimization. Local lawyers provide correct e-contracts. Local agents provide debt recovery. 
Decentralized Data and App
Different Types of Collateral
Cryptocurrencies and tokens, via bitShares technology. Real Estate. There's already an API in Russia, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine and there'll be more. Goods and services. Automatic p2p-factoring is already exist. Gold and other digitalized assets: Digix, ChronoBank, BankEx.
Total Automation 
Smart Scoring
Mutual Responsibility
Business Development
Loans For Future Delivery
Profitable for investors: significant discounts, or re-selling tokens at the exchange for profit. 
Profitable for manufacturers: make money today, make turnover faster, promote his own goods and services, payments with his own goods and services. 
This is a foundation for the barter economy like Swiss WIR.
