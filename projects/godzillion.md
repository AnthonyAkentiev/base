## Business Model
Godzillion is a decentralized platform connecting startups and investors that operates on the Ethereum Blockchain.
Godzillion allows small businesses to be voted on (“Yes” or “No”) to access a crowdfunding market, and to issue their startup tokens in exchange for GODZ.
Investors vote on startups to earn incentives, then invest in these startups, and gain access to a secondary market where they can sell or buy more various startup tokens.
In this secondary market ("exchange" market) GODZ tokens can be exchanged for a startup’s tokens; d for Ether;
Godzillion’s Dapp runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine and does not use a central server to run user processes or logs.  
Token Allocation (300,000,000 GODZ, no growth rate):  
* 210,000,000 GODZ will be offered during the crowdsale  
* 45,000,000 GODZ will be directly allocated to early contributors who have worked to develop the ideas, implementations, and supporting structures of the Godzillion project up to the time of the Crowd Sale.   
* 45,000,000 GODZ will be directly allocated to the Godzillion Stiftung Foundation for payment of future expenses.
