## Business Model
Hive serves as a decentralized data room for all invoices submitted, each of which has a unique record for the issuer, owner and payer. These invoices can therefore be made available as a shared source of liquidity for factoring and invoice financing.  
Hive provides an end-to-end platform that will give SMEs easy access to short-term financing by turning their
accounts receivables into tradable assets. This is achieved by tokenizing and publishing each invoice to s
blockchain in a secure matter, creating a whole new source of financing in the process. A new meta-market
will be created, where factoring firm, banks, investment funds, insurance companies, P2P lenders and
private investors can provide liquidity in accordance with their specific criteria and expected returns. 
  
A HVN token grants the token holder the right to claim right over invoices on the Hive platform and obtain
credit scores for certain entities which have a sufficient financial track record on the Hive blockchain
When, for example, a factor who is financing SME wants to claim ownership of invoice they financed and by that
bought, they will need to pay HVN tokens to Hive foundation. Also when Credit Scoring company or auditor
will request access to private in data on the blockchain, HVN tokens will be used to pay for access to that
data. Hive foundation will resell tokens back to the market and use funds for financing of development of
infrastructure.
