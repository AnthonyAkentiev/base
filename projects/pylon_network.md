## Business Model
Pylon is a network structured with only one purpose: to create the first open renewable energy exchange community, which will provide the energy markets with the signals and financial incentives that current energy policies and governance systems are failing to provide. Users of Pylon can exchange green energy, bought directly from the RES producer and without need for intervention of intermediaries throughout the process; this is achieved through the application of blockchain technology and smart contracts. At the same time, Pylon-Coin, which will be used for payment of all green energy transactions, is utilized within the financial eco-system that we are proposing (the Pylon Network), in order to reward the production of sustainable energy and financially support projects on sustainable technologies.
