## Business Model
Tierion works by creating a proof that links data to a transaction on a blockchain. This is called anchoring. Anyone with this proof can verify the dataâ€™s integrity and timestamp without relying on a trusted authority. Since launching in 2015, over a thousand companies have used Tierion, including large enterprises like Microsoft, Philips, as well as innovative startups such as Accredible and Tokken.
