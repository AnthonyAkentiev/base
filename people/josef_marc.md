## About
Josef Marc leads the Publica team. Although he didn’t originate the Publica idea in its earliest form, he volunteered to write the white paper that thought it through to its logical ends, and decided to help bring it to fruition.  
His experience leading teams in the launch of DirecTV, 500 channels of fully-automated digital satellite television, and the launch of Verizon FIOS TV, national cable television on a telephone system backbone, prepared him for Publica because we too are launching something that hasn’t been done before. Also part technology, part operations, marshalling hundreds of people in multimillion-dollar budgets, in the public eye.   
He’s helped startup companies to reach healthy success before. He co-founded Archimedia Technology, acquired by GrayMeta. At Front Porch Digital, acquired by Oracle, he designed systems and operations that preserved and made digitally accessible the ten-year videotaped history of the United Nations Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. At SAMMA Systems he worked closely with the United States Library of Congress NAVCC technical and operations teams. His first technology job was in a startup that was acquired by Sony to form its broadcast systems integration company in what the media calls an aquihire today.  
At Sony he managed teams building two Olympics broadcast centers for CBS, several Jumbotron control rooms including New York Times Square, and innovative entertainment and interactive television systems for Celebrity Cruises “cyberships.” We can take systems like those for granted today but somebody had to do them the first time.  
He’s comfortable with technology on the leading edge, learning it and explaining it so others can understand it from their own perspectives. As a longtime member of the Society for Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) he authored four technical papers, presented them to critical audiences at SMPTE’s annual conventions, and contributed steadily to standards committees.  
Josef’s first career was in music and that’s when he first learned how publishing and self-publishing work. He and a partner wrote, recorded, printed, sold and shipped their own music on vinyl records until the manager of The Police, a superstar group, signed them to a publishing deal for his company. He’s a constant reader, always interested in the economics of publishing. He studied in the pre-law curriculum at the University of San Diego.
