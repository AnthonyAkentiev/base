## About
Irfon's was born in Llanwrtyd Wells the home of Sospan Fach, Bog Snorkeling and the Man vs Horse Race, basically the maddest and best village in the World... Leaving school with 2 failed A levels his career began when he left Wales for London. After successfully holding lead roles at Del and Computacenter, Irfon then joined Florida based CommerceQuest, from where he led the acquisition and running of six software companies across Africa and Europe. Following this stint, Irfon decided that he wanted to set up his own company. He felt online video was the next great medium and that passively watching it wasn't good enough. He created Coull, which now has offices in Bristol, London, New York and Santa Barbara. It employs 38 people and delivers over 2bn video ads a month across 80 Countries.
