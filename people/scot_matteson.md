## About
Scot Matteson has over 25 years of real estate finance and development experience. He is the co-founder of Centurion Partners, directs the firm's project financing, investment strategy, venture and capital partnerships, debt facilities and equity structuring. Under Mr. Matteson's management, Centurion Partners has grown into a firm with a portfolio of approximately $1 billion. With his extensive relationships within a large number of real estate finance venues, Mr. Matteson, pursuant to a high-yielding investment strategy, has brought capital to Centurion Partners for two milestone projects in Aspen, two in San Diego and one in Miami. Mr. Matteson's vision for Centurion Partners has always been real estate development of best-in-class projects in areas that have demonstrated a high degree of cyclical stability and desirability with significant barriers to entry. Among his achievements at Centurion Partners, Mr. Matteson, together with his partner Michael Smith, successfully identified and developed an iconic location in Aspen, Colorado, which became The Residences at Little Nell.
After attending the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he studied Economics, Mr. Matteson founded Matteson Development Corporation, an entrepreneurial real estate development firm specializing in commercial retail and industrial product. Mr. Matteson subsequently co-founded American Realty and Financial Services of California, Inc., a real estate investment specialist that, under Mr. Matteson's leadership, grew to a 100-person, nine-office firm with $15 billion in mortgage banking and brokerage, direct investment, and principal transactions. Mr. Matteson also formed Boston American Financial Group, which evolved into a 20-person firm with over $5.5 billion of single tenant financing.
