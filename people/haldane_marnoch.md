## About
Hal has a background in full-stack technology and ten years of experience working in foreign exchange, including six years spent in support of Morgan Stanleyâ€™s FX trading desks and underlying tech systems as a front office IT engineer. Latterly, he co-founded an online FX remittance company, serving as both its director and CTO, which specializes in currency transfers to and from South East Asia. Hal is convinced that crypto systems are now mature enough to unite the crypto world with the traditional financial world, yielding considerable mutual benefits.
