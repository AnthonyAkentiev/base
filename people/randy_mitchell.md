## About
Randy Mitchell is a technology professional with product management, software development, UX and founding experience. As a product manager and software developer, heâ€™s worked with various technologies including SaaS, E-Commerce and Healthcare Innovation solutions. He became casually interested in blockchain technology in 2011 after learning about Bitcoin. His interest became more professionally intentional in 2016 after a conversation that introduced him to The Ethereum Project and its notion of a decentralized platform for building unstoppable applications as a blockchain use case.
