## About
Dr. Greene is a practicing pediatrician, author, speaker, e-health leader, children’s health advocate, and father of four. He has devoted himself to freely giving real answers to parents' real questions -- from questions about those all too common childhood conditions to those that address the most rare childhood illnesses. His answers combine cutting edge science, practical wisdom, warm empathy, and a deep respect for parents, children, and the environment. He is also an electrifying public speaker, and has personally touched many during his talks in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. A graduate of Princeton and UCSF, he launched DrGreene.com in 1995, cited by the AMA as “the pioneer physician Web site”. In 2010, Dr. Greene founded the WhiteOut Now movement aimed at changing how babies are fed starting with their first bite of solid food and in 2012, TICC TOCC - Transitioning Immediate Cord Clamping To Optimal Cord Clamping. Dr. Greene was the Founding President of the Society for Participatory Medicine and continues to serve on their board of directors. He also serves on the board of The Lundberg Institute. He appears frequently in the media including such venues as the TODAY Show, the Dr. Oz Show, Good Morning America, Fox and Friends, The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and Time Magazine. He has served as a columnist for Parenting Magazine and as the online Pediatric Expert for WebMD. He is also the Pediatric Expert for The People’s Pharmacy (as heard on NPR). He was the original Pediatric Expert for both Yahoo! and iVillage. Dr. Greene is the author of Feeding Baby Green (Wiley, 2009) Raising Baby Green (Wiley, 2007), From First Kicks to First Steps (McGraw-Hill, 2004). He received the Healthy Child Healthy World Award for Prevention for his outstanding work and was named “The Children's Health Hero of the Internet” by Intel.
