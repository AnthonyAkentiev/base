## About
After spending ten years in the City of London, gaining experience at various magic circle law firms, Oliver began working for Bank of America’s legal department in London.
In 2008 he took over the AVP position at the bank’s asset based lending division. As lenders of last resort to distressed companies, Oliver was tasked with ensuring that the bank’s exposure to its clients was protected.
Invoice financing is just one of the many forms of financing Oliver has experience in, and his practical experience in this area will be important in helping Hive achieve its objectives.
