## Business Model
The Publishing and Content Tokenization Platform
Rakugo is a secure, decentralized publishing platform that rewards contributors with revenue and exposure for their content. Content is secured and published as a tokenized digital asset, allowing anyone to manage, distribute, and monetize their content. Each quarter token holders and writers get paid a royalty from Rakugoâ€™s revenue.
