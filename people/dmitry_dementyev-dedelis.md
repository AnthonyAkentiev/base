## About
First interest in computers and broken Win95 system experienced at the age of 12. Later on dived into web development. Always tried to understand why things work and how they are made. Have tried myself in publishing sector, since I could not take criticism very well about my "artsy" side, decided to move along and focus on web-development. At the age of 18 got my first job as the HTML-JS-CSS guy to support Magento project development. After 6 months I understood that I have reached a certain level where it is not challenging and interesting for me anymore. After I quit my job, I went on a 9 month-long trip to Thailand, where I understood better how the supply and demand work, widened my perspective of world and gave Real Estate industry a try. That was not for me. Came back to Latvia and begun to work as Lead Developer in advertising agency. That was fun, stressful work environment where I got a perfect sense of amount of work necessary to carry out a task and how a 10-day task can be accomplished in 3 days. Also learned the hard way all the consequences of doing so. Found my next place of residency in start-up sector working for the project Funderful. With small workshop I am in charge of all IT related tasks. I could describe this experience as being Full-Stack-Full-Stack Developer. I plan tasks for an IT team, create and support an architecture, manage communication with clients about IT related topics, offer out-of-ordinary solutions to benefit all the parties involved, try to foresee all possible caveats year in advance and give reasonable deadlines for rest of the team and clients.
