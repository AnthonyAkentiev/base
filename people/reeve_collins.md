## About
Serial entrepreneur in the digital media space.
Reeve Collins has been a long-standing pioneer in the Bitcoin/Blockchain space and was co-founder and CEO of Tether. His efforts revolutionized the way currency is transacted by creating the worldâ€™s first fiat currency platform on the Bitcoin blockchain. In just over one year from inception, Tether was acquired by Bitfinex the world's largest bitcoin exchange. 

Prior to Tether, Collins founded several successful ventures, including Traffic Marketplace, one of the first online ad networks to be acquired by Vivendi Universal, RedLever, a branded entertainment studio, acquired by Adconion Media Group, and Pala Interactive, where he secured $70 million to create a legal, real-money gambling site in the US that is live today. 

Currently, Collins is creating an entirely new economy around digital goods as co-founder and CEO of BLOCKv. BLOCKv provides an innovative platform for the creation of a new class of virtual goods called vAtoms. vAtoms are interactive smart objects on blockchains, enabling ownership, scarcity, and authenticity of digital goods for the first time.
