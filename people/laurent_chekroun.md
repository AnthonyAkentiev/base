## About
Laurent is a graduate from one on the top French universities ISG in the past. Prior to founding Kencoin, He has worked for top financial firms and investment houses over the past 25 years. His work experience includes Goldman Sachs, Société Générale Investment Bank and Cantor Fitzgerald amongst others. The Ashley Madison data breach caused great harm to a lot of innocent individuals who were promised 100% privacy. This and other flaws in the adult entertainment industry caused Laurent to come up with an alternate payment method for pornography and dating websites. That alternate payment method became Kencoin. Laurent made sure that this method will be 100% anonymous and untraceable, therefor guaranteeing consumer’s privacy & security.
