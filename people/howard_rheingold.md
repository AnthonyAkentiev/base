[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Rheingold)  
As a critic, writer and teacher, Howard Rheingoldâ€™s specialties are on the cultural, social and political implications of modern communication media such as the Internet, mobile telephony and virtual communities. His book Tools for Thought tells of the history of those who created the personal computer. About that same time he first logged in to an influential early online community called The WELL. That experienced is explored in his seminal book The Virtual Community.
