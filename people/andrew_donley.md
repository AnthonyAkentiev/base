## About
In 2015, Andrew founded BitMesh, backed by BoostVC and Tim Draper, that focused on buying and selling internet bandwidth via micropayments and Bitcoin. After opensourcing BitMesh, he joined Leet to lead the engineering team. As CTO, Andrew has expanded Leet’s services from esports P2P wagering to stratum mining pools and tournament management software in casinos. With Unikrn’s recent acquisition of Leet, Andrew will contribute to the creation of UnikoinGold with his skills across engineering, cryptocurrency, and R&D.
