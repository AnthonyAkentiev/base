## About
As the former vice president of Netscape’s Web Design and Site Integration Department, and the recent Co-founder of his own eponymous design consulting firm, Dubberly – like his favorite Greek philosopher – is a professional shiner of light into the murk and ambiguity of life. “My central concern is to figure out how design can be employed to make complex ideas visible and understandable so that we can make better products”, he says. With impeccable design and digital pedigrees, Dubberly has been on the cusp of “what’s next” since the Internet’s early days. It’s worthwhile, then, to pay attention to his present thoughts on what’s next for the business of design – and the design of business.
