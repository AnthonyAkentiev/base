## About
The blockchain revolution and its demand for experienced high-quality services is sure to grow exponentially and that’s where Antons Sapriko comes in. Antons grew a company of two people to a hundred times that size and an industry leader serving the very top retail companies. He brings highly adaptive and growth-oriented business management strategies into Publica’s fold.  
Antons is responsible for operational management in Publica. His experience leading Scandiweb from a local agency to becoming the largest ecommerce services provider on the Magento platform will help Publica take care of business. He will bootstrap Publica’s roles for marketing, HR, development, quality assurance, creative infrastructure, and technology services for all Internet-connected platforms.  
Publica benefits from Antons’ experience in setting up workflows for enterprise-grade delivery to Walmart, Jaguar, Land Rover, The New York Times, Peugeot and many other brands and startups since 2003.  
Antons started his contribution to the blockchain revolution in 2014 leading a series of workshops explaining to the Scandiweb team how the Bitcoin blockchain works. Blockchain-related workshops and practice sessions led to go-live projects and they continue to this day. As of this writing, in July 2017 he and his teams built and launched successful smart contracts and blockchain apps for the launch of large-scale Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for $25 and $30 millions led by USA-based Element Group.  
Antons comes from a technology background. His father made the first-ever dial-up connection in his country in 1986. Antons learned to code at 14 and won top places in Math Olympiads on the national level. He earned a Bachelor degree in Business Administration at Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, a top-20 business school and started Master of Science at the IT University of Copenhagen.
