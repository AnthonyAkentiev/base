## About
Nikolay graduated from the prestigious ESSEC business school in France and later went to pursue a career in law. He later became the Senior Intellectual Property Attorney for Louis Vuitton. During his 18 years of working for Louis Vuitton, he gained a lot of insight on what clients want. Many clients want their privacy assured and to know that they are 100% secure while making a transaction. The emphasis Kencoin has on anonymity and security is what drew Nikolay to this project. He quickly established an extensive network in the adult industry worldwide. Kencoinâ€™s guarantee of anonymity and security helped him expand that network.
