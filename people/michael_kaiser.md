## About
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Kaiser15)  
Michael combines the best of 2 worlds. He is a businessperson and a computer scientist. As an alumnus from the commercial college in Kitzb√ºhel and having a degree in computer science, he combines both, the technical know-how needed to create an advanced job market system on the Blockchain and the economical expertise to run a successful company. On one hand, he is able to understand the underlying mechanics of the market and the needs of the many people involved, but on the other hand, he is also an enthusiastic computer scientist and coder. He is able to recognize the economic potential of new technologies much faster than anyone else, because he has the knowledge to understand the technology in depth, and his expertise in economics empowers him to realize the practicability of new developments and the economic impacts they will have. Michael has a penchant for well-thought and simple-to-use applications. His credo is to design his applications as simple to use as possible. The underlying complexity of technologies should not interfere with the users experience. Michael worked as a researcher at the University of Innsbruck. He is also Co-founder of LambdaDynamics. A company that is specialized on bringing businesses to the next level by employing Machine Learning. His main fields are Cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain and Machine Learning.
