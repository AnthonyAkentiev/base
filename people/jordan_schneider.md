## About
Iâ€™m an entrepreneur with a portfolio of successful business campaigns and products. I currently work as CEO of Sage Fitness Studios and CEO of BeatPals, a streaming service aimed to help empower upcoming musicians. My newest endeavors are as co-owner of a new healthy eatery called Health Kitchen in Whitestone NY as well as Head of Marketing for the Obsidian Platform, a security/privacy focused, blockchain integrated, messenger app.
I am a huge enthusiast of cryptocurrency and have been involved since 2013 (Head of Marketing for Worldcoin) both as an investor and project manager. I am a very proud Ethereum ICO holder!
I am a creative thinker, offering outside the box solutions to businesses of any variety. I tend to focus on the long term goal or "big picture" and am therefore always very interested in startups and new ventures.
