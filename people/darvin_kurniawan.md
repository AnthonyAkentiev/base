## About
Started off with a technical background. Worked as a Software Engineer (application & website) and Project Management. Involved in Branding & Marketing a bit later (Specializing in Digital Signage from planning, conceptualization, execution) and grew to a full fledged (with proven results) Business Development guy.
Great interest in new business ideas and started a few (read details below the summary section). I am the idea guy and the execution guy. Especially interested in social entrepreneurship.
Passionate about Blue Ocean Strategy (www.blueoceanstrategy.com) and strives to include BOS thinking in my daily decision making process. BOS helps create Nintendo Wii and Air Asia among other great things.
Associated with Emergenetics (www.emergenetics.com) as the latest leading tool in understanding people's thinking and behaviour preferences.
Great interest in Psychology. Believe that knowledge in how the mind works will help in understanding how the world functions - or at least how to close the next deal.
Specialties: Business Development, Business Setup/Creation, Marketing & Branding, Digital Signage, Information Technology, Blue Ocean Strategy, Emergenetics.
