## About
As a scientifically minded artist, Keita grew up in Tokyo then moved to Honolulu where he attended middle and high school. As the lead programmer for his high school robotics team, he led his team to two time (2009,2010) state championships at the East Oahu VEX robotics competitions. As an award winning filmmaker, his film Foliage: Roots of the Tree Barrel won the 2014 HIFF (Hawaii International Film Festival) student showcase and was named San Diego Surf Film Festival's Emerging Filmmaker. During his undergraduate career, after reading about Mt.Gox in late 2013, he found a new passion for cryptocurrencies and blockchain which made him switch his degree from Computer Science to Management Science (Quantitative Economics). Being the Assistant Curator for the UC San Diego Film Festival, Keita was exposed to VR since 2014. When he first experienced the google cardboard and the HTC vive, he decided that could no longer be a painter when photography just got invented, sort of speak. This led him to learn as much as he could about VR. At the Festival he met Steve, who told him about his idea for Nanome (formerly NanoVR) in April 2015.
