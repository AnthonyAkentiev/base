## About
Sebastian Serrano is the CEO and Co-Founder of BitPagos and Ripio. Starting as a skillful developer at a very early age and then leading a succesful web and mobile development startup, Sebastian played major roles in several fintech startups such as PayMentez, MetaTiendas and Moni.
Serrano and his team founded BitPagos in 2013. A year later, they launched Ripio, one of the most popular Bitcoin wallets in Argentina. People use Ripio to buy, save and sell bitcoins and now they can also apply for Ripio Credit: a blockchain-based feature that allows users to pay in installments in local currency. Ripio is the first Bitcoin wallet in the World to offer this kind of service.
