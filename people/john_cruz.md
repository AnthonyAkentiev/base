## About
Since 1992, John Cruz (JBX) has been an independent financial trader and a member of seven exchanges (CME, CBOT, MID-AM, COMEX, MATIF, Eurex, and SGX). John trades stocks, bonds, futures, options, metals, commodities and currencies. With the emergence of cryptocurrencies, John found a perfect fit and he has traded them for the past four years. His trading instinct soon identified market inefficiencies and untapped opportunities. Long delays in settlement times for transactions along with hacking vulnerabilities each clearly needed attention. He also identified a huge potential for bringing back the droves of small investors who had fled the algo-driven equity markets, and he became determined to open the door to their renewed participation. This combination of factors led to his originating of the concept for Ankorus, recognising the means and the moment to potentially transform global markets.
