## About
As Chief Technology Officer, Steven Sykes, brings over 20 years of technology experience to the Centra development and deployment team. Steven started his career as a software developer, then worked database management and design technologies, before being engaged in communications solutions, working for a Fortune 25 healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical multinational corporation. Steve was a member of the two start-up initiatives within the corporation; one was the multi-billion dollar success of the cardio-vascular stent. 
Due to his extensive knowledge of the business and the computing and networking technologies, he then managed the infrastructure for the southeast region, which included remote datacenters, network services, help desk and all key operational services. During this time Steve also received extensive management and professional skills training, including his Six Sigma Black Belt.
Following the success in the delivery of those key operational services, and because of his end-to-end knowledge of core technologies, Steven became the Global Manager of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery for the corporation.
Most recently Steven has been working with a diverse software engineering firm on mobile technologies ranging from computer vision and scanning technologies, to proprietary encryption and messaging solutions.
Now that Steve has joined the Centra team, he is charged with driving the delivery of the Centra product to completion, with his initial focus on:  
•	Security  
•	Transactional Integrity  
•	Operational Excellence
