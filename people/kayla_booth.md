## About
I am passionate about all things technology and people! I enjoy helping organizations and executives build their teams and hire the best IT talent so they can focus on the business and technology itself. When I'm not tackling the challenges of the finding the best and bridging the skills gap, I am giving back. For a number of years, I have been on the Women in Technology (WIT) Women of The Year Awards Committee and served as an active member on the Association of Telecom Professionals (ATP) Board of Directors. I am also active with the Technology Association of Georgia and regularly volunteer with TechBridge, a technology non-profit for non-profit organizations.
