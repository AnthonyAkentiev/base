## About
I am a skilled business development lead who achieves consistent market growth and innovation through a range of strategies including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, new market analysis, as well as partnering and investment opportunities. With extensive background in IT, emerging technologies, engineering and operations (including roles with Cisco Systems and others), I am well-positioned to help organizations navigate the many diverse challenges inherent in todayâ€™s complex, fast-paced, digital and cloud-based business environment. My key objective is to identify and leverage opportunities for increasing revenue. In my current role with Recruit, for example, I generated new business, exceeding sales projections. I performed market and financial analyses that led the company into new sectors and successful ventures. My experience includes setting strategic agenda, overseeing strategic initiatives from concept to launch, delivering growth and quickly forging relationships that enhance profit, operations and performance.
