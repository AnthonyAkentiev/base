## About
Johnson came from a traditional shipping background where he spent the first seven years of his career with Maersk Line in Denmark, Brazil and China before working for Hutchison Port Holdings as an Investment Manager specialized in acquiring and negotiating port concessions in the Middle East region. Johnson’s last assignment with Maersk was the eCommerce project at the headquarters, where he provided business logic for the development of Maersk Line’s on-line platform, similar to our TEU Ecosystem. Moving from industry to the finance world, he was the regional shipping analyst at JP Morgan and then a senior shipping analyst for Tufton Oceanic, the largest shipping hedge fund, before joining Jefferies as their Head of Regional Transport and Industrials Research for the Asia Pacific region. Johnson is a graduate of Maersk Shipping Academy and HKUST, and holds an INSEAD MBA.
