## About
Alexander is an entrepreneur in the wholesale/retail trading sphere, and a private investor, with experience in online and offline business since 1995. In 2003, he built a network of retail shops in Saint-Petersburg which were sold in 2011 for $11 million. After that successful exit, he has changed his focus from offline to online. Alexander invested in KICKICO in 2015 and, since that time, works closely with the team, taking care of its presentation and financial model.
