## About
I'm start doing business since my university years (Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation). After graduation in 2013, in cooperation with another Jincor cofounder, Vladislav Kirichenko, set up our first company â€” Triumph, LLC, which cumulative revenue for the three years of its existence amounted to more than $5 mln. In 2015, acquired a large manufacturer of ready-made food products Munchies. In the first three months my management bring the loss-making company to profit, completely change the staff and upgrade the equipment; after just a year Munchies revenue figures increased twice.
