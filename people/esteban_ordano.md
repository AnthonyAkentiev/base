## About
[Interview with Esteban Ordano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCA-I0o_gvY)  
A seasoned blockchain engineer, Esteban co-founded Zeppelin Solutions and led the team that created Streamium, the first app that implemented payment channels, a crucial technology for scaling blockchain payments. As a former software engineer at BitPay, he co-created one of the leading Bitcoin infrastructure libraries, known as Bitcore. He was also on the teams behind Copay (a bitcoin wallet) and Insight (a bitcoin blockchain API).  
Esteban spent his formative years competing in math and computer science olympiads, investing two summers working as a Software Engineering intern at Google. Throughout college, he was also a Tech Lead at Monits, an Argentine software company that was acquired by MercadoLibre. As with other core Decentraland team members, Esteban co-founded Voltaire, a blockchain-focused hacker space in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
