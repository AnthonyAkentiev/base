## About
Bill Crean is a Product Philosopher. He applies techniques and methodologies refined in over 15 years of high-tech Product and Program Management in big and small companies alike. Specializing in market expansion and new product creation, Bill held critical roles in helping the Texas Instruments Wireless Division venture from 2G to 3G to 4G… from feature phones to smartphones to tablets… and from North America / Europe to Asia, generating tens of millions of dollars of new revenues, and increasing top-line growth through customer successes. In addition, Bill led InterDigital Communications into a new market, developing and executing a new product and strategy for Digital Media, starting from scratch.
Bill earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, and started his career as a Software Developer. It is with this rich background that Bill brings his affinity for bringing order out of chaos into the startup world with Verif-y. Bill and his family reside in the Philadelphia suburbs, where he enjoys coaching youth sports, playing basketball, and bird watching.
