## Summary

Bluzelle CTO, explained how decentralized databeses can be applied for Fintech industry.
The basic opportunity in Fintech industry is KYC (Know Your Customer) process which is an enormous pain for financial institutions. The regulatory requirements are increasing and this bears a big financial cost on banks.
This issue can be solved by a KYC Shared Ledger blockchain application. The KYC Shared Ledger application enable banks to:  
* Onboard customers faster and cheaper.
* Share information between one another.  
* Manage and update customer data easily.

Once on-boarded, the customer’s entire profile is encrypted and stored securely and permanently to the blockchain. Bluzelle used a proprietary multi-party key encryption protocol that enabled the banks to “own” their customers’ private data, but allowed data to be shared with other banks that are specifically authorized only by the customers themselves.
