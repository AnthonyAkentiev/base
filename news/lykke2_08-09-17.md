### Project: [Lykke](../projects/lykke.md)
### Date: 08 September 2017
## Summary
  
Lykke announces the grand opening of Lykke de México S.A. de C.V., a Mexican subsidiary designed to bring the unique Lykke trading experience to the Latin American market.
This new subsidiary is the direct result of Lykke Streams, Lykke’s innovative platform for crowdsourcing contributions to projects of all kinds. A project called “Set up a new Lykke venture in your city,” posted by Lykke founder and CEO Richard Olsen, brought the team that eventually become Lykke de México.
In the spirit of Lykke’s vision, Lykke de México will be more than just a branch office. It will be a localized, responsive, and fully integrated part of the Latin American financial community and a vital point of entry to the Lykke Exchange.
