### Project: [NEO](../projects/neo.md)
### Date: 18 October 2017
## Summary
  
[Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/) a new Hong Kong based exchange that began operations last month, is supporting for both NEO and GAS markets.
Users who hold NEO on Kucoin will have GAS distributed to their accounts daily. A snapshot of NEO account balances is taken at 00:00 UTC +8, and GAS distribution occurs immediately, where most users will receive GAS before 1:00 UTC +8.
  
Kucoin is the second exchange to distribute GAS to NEO holders, and the first exchange to distribute GAS daily. The first exchange to do so is Binance, which distributes GAS to NEO holders on a monthly basis.
