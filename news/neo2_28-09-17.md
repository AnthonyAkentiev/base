Two major updates in NEO traiding:  
* Binance opened a NEO/ETH market for trading.
Binance are currently the only exchange that distributes GAS to traders who hold NEO on their platform.
Earlier in the month, Binance gave away a total of 5,000 GAS to 10,000 users who deposited NEO into their Binance accounts.
They have also been running a ‘Trading Competition’ for September, where the top 500 traders in NEO by volume win GAS prizes.  
* HitBTC opens NEO markets with BTC, ETH and USDT trading pairs. HitBTC is a European based exchange that has been in operation since 2013 and has over 160 markets available, along with no limits for depositing or withdrawal of digital assets.
