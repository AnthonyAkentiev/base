The main goal of this cooperation is to utilizes the Nxt technology and develop a Blockchain that will ease barriers in the international transfers.
International transactions are often bogged down by heavy fees and little to no transparency. The Blockchain technology, specifically the Nxt platform, will free BNP from restraints caused by swift codes and correspondent banks, which often overcomplicate international transactions. This is just the first step in utilizing Nxtâ€™s technology in order to ease international transactions across the globe.
