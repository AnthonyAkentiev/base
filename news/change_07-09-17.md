## Summary
Indorse CEO, David Moskowitz, had announced a partnership with Change, an upcoming decentralised crypto bank.
The goal of the partnership for Change is to obtain the access to Indorse’s trust based system as an additional mechanism to validate the credentials and skills of applicants for the Change marketplace.
“An issue we foresee us facing is that of credibility and due diligence of our partner companies”, says Kristjan Kangro, CEO of Change. Indorse will help to solve this issue. 
In addition, Indorse token holders will in the future be able to spend the tokens using a Change card, as well as in the Change marketplace for various investments and insurance products.
