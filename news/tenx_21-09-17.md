## Summary
  
TenX Team had reported that from the 16th of October cardholders outside of the European territory will not be able to use TenX Visa Card. 
This situation occurs due to policy changes of TenX's card issuer partner, Wave Crest Holdings Limited.
In late-August 2017, WaveCrest informed that they would no longer issue and maintain Visa® Prepaid Cards to TenX cardholders outside of the Europe.
  
To solve this issue TenX are onboarding alternative card issuers who can issue cards outside of Europe.
"It will take us some time to integrate our systems with theirs, and to print new cards issued by these alternative issuers.
We’re currently targeting a November 2017 launch for these new cards, so look out for more information regarding this in the coming weeks", says TenX Team.
