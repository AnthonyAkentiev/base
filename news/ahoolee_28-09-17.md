## Summary

Ahoolee's ICO didn't reach soft cap. This was steted in the Ahoolee's Facebook post.
Every investor, participated in the ICO, will get refund.
From the mistakes that was made during the ICO Ahoolee's Team mentioned:  
"1. The most important thing is that we didn't communicate personally with professional investors. We did it on pre-sale but on ICO we were confident about closing the round in any case.  
2. We used too complicated ICO scheme. We decided to go against market rules and act as it is accepted in the venture market - to collect a small round with a huge discount, then collect some more but still with a big discount, etc. We carried out our rounds far apart in time. Such scheme normally work on the venture market but there are other rules in the ICO market.  
3. Huge discounts on pre-sale and seed-round. We focused on the amount of venture rounds in calculating tokens prices. In venture market, a huge discount is given at the pre-seed round due to the huge risks. It turned out that in the ICO market such a discount only discourages investors.  
4. Description of the project was too complex.  
5. PR in mass media was not provided in time.  
6. Work with the community should be more active. We got an active Russian-speaking community and very inactive English-speaking one.  
7. Advisors are needed from the very beginning. We attracted the advisers quite late.  
8. Our overconfidence didnâ€™t help as well. In fact, it affected everything but one of the most serious consequences is a too complicated smart contract followed by inability to extend the duration of the ICO, etc."
  
The next step of the Ahoolee's Team will be:  
* repackage the product and may be even rebrand it.  
* communicate the globality of idea to the big investors.  
* conduct pre-sale and ICO according to the usual market scheme, attracting professional investors in advance.
