## Summary
* Poland-based exchange BitBay is set to launch a trading platform in India wich will support Bitcoin 
and 6 altcoins, including Monero. In official press release BitBay India states: "The prime objective of 
BitBay India is to remove all misconceptions related to cryptocurrency, 
drive more people towards digital currencies, attract potential investors from markets 
and offer an all-round platform to trade as well as exchange multiple cryptocurrencies at BitBay."
Notably, Indian authorities have been exploring a regulatory framework for the legal future of bitcoin and 
other digital currencies in the country with an inter-governmental committee tasked to the job earlier in 
March. Details of their work haven't been made public yet, but all signs point to the government recognizing 
bitcoin with regulations that will also include taxing bitcoin adopters.
