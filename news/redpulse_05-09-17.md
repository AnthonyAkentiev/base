## Summary
Jonathan Ha, Red Pulse Co-Founder, had annouced that upcoming crowdsale is postponed.
The main reason of delay is recent decision of the China's Central Bank to ban investments throught ICO process.  
As it was said by Jonathan:
"Thank you everyone for your patience regarding recent regulatory announcements.
We are not cancelling the sale, but are planning to spend more time to better understand the current regulatory environment...
That being said, we want to ensure we are 100% compliant with all related regulations and policies before moving forward.
We are consulting with tax, advisory, and legal professionals that have prior experience with ICOs, and will do everything in our ability to ensure we are operating according to government policies and legal boundaries.
Thank you everyone for your interest and support, and we'll provide more updates when available."
