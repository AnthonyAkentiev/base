### Project: [Fluence](../projects/fluence.md)
### Date: 11 October 2017
## Summary
  
Flunce Team announced new date of the main tokensale - now it's planned to the beginning of 2018 instead of Q4 2017, as planned before.
This decision was taken due to few reasons:  
* High market competition  
currently, up to 100 new sales come to it every week. Many of these projects donâ€™t receive enough attention and cannot reach their goals.
It leads to a situation when they cannot get enough liquidity on exchanges and therefore be listed on the major ones.  
* Right legal jurisdiction  
For the main tokensale, Fluence Team is having a conversation with Zug-based law firm MME which previously successfully incorporated Ethereum, Tezos, Golem, Bancor, Melonport.
This should provide a better branding and increase the confidence of main tokensale contributors  
* Tokensale partner  
Fluence Team is looking for the partner who can presale project to major investors right before the tokensale.  
* Prototype release  
Fluence Team is willing to have a proof of concept of the product before the tokensale to prove that the product is actually feasible.
