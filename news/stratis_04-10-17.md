## Summary
  
As part of Stratis' new communications strategy, Chris Trew (Startis CEO) will be sharing information and platform updates at random intervals from now on.
The latest update includes several topics:  
* Breeze  
The Breeze wallet Beta on the Strat blockchain has been through several rounds of internal testing and will now be handed over to our closed community testers.
If there are no major bugs found the production release will come very soon.  
* ICO Platform  
ICO Platform has been through several rounds of improvements and optimizations, such as replacing email 2FA with Google Authenticator.
Stratus Team is now very confident that platform is ready for mainstream use, and a test ICO on STRAT testnet will be launched soon.
* Full Node  
The full node has been through extensive internal testing and over the next few weeks Stratis team will be finalizing the GUI to launch a full node on Stratis testnet.
* Sidechains  
Stratis Team hope to release our Sidechains technical whitepaper in the next few weeks.
