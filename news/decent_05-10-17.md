## Summary
  
DECENT Team had posted blog post about the first major update of DECENT GO beta.
DECENT GO is a Google Play-like digital marketplace built on top of a blockchain platform allowing digital content exchange and purchasing on a peer-to-peer basis.
  
The web application was launched back in June, but until now it has contained only wallet and basic account creation options. Now the marketplace functionality is added and DECENT Team is looking forward to watch the platform growth with all sorts of digital content.
As beta users will get an access and a first look at the ability to publish digital content in any format, choose seeders, setup publisher profiles, browse and buy peer-published content.
For now, seeding will be limited to between 1 day and 1 week - as DECENT Team is gathering data and user feedback. Current release is not final product, it's meant to "test" functionality, so not all planned features have been included.
