### Project: [TenX](../projects/tenx.md)
### Date: 06 September 2017 
## Summary
On the latest VLOG Julian Hosp, TenX Co-Founder, introduced vision and the core goal of TenX as a company:  
"At TenX, it is our vision to have a decentralized marketplace full of financial services that provide the lowest 
cost, highest security and best performance to its users..."  
This statement is crucial because till now TenX was viewed on a market as an wallet and the card that helps to make cryptocurrencies spendable everywhere.
However now TenX becomes a direct competitor to [Change Bank](../projects/change.md) (a market place for the financial services) that is launching ICO on September 16th.
