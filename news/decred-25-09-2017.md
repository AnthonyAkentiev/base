### Date: 25 September 2017
## Summary
The first cross-chain atomic swap between Decred and Litecoin. This is an important step in a direction that allows users to conduct trustless, cross-chain, over-the-counter (“OTC”) trades without a third party. This disintermediates the exchange process between cryptocurrencies that support these swap transactions.

There are some privacy and transparency consequences related to on-chain atomic swaps that are not present with centralized exchanges. 

The atomic swap process has been tested against dcrwallet (CLI), Decrediton (GUI), Bitcoin Core, and Litecoin Core.
