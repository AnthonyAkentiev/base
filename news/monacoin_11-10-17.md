## Summary
  
Exchange BitFlyer has added Monacoin (MONA) trading to its platform.
BitFlyer will allow direct trading between JPY and MONA, without having to trade via BTC.
The platform also has trading in BTC and BCC, ETH and ETC, and LTC.
BitFlyer is one of the oldest and most popular digital asset exchanges still operating in Japan. It’s arguably also the most prominent public face of Bitcoin in Japan, thanks to a long-running TV ad and poster campaign.
At the beginning of October it became the third exchange to obtain an operating license from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA).  
In addition, Monacoin's price went up x5 in the last [7 days](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monacoin/), now it's traiding around $5
