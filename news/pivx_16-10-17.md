### Project: [PIVX](../projects/pivx.md)
### Date: 16 October 2017
## Summary
  
As part of its roadmap earlier indicated some months ago, PIVX has started the implementation of the Zerocoin Protocol for more secure end-to-end transaction anonymity.
The Zerocoin Protocol uses a cryptographic method known as the Zero-Knowledge proof.
It enables a party to prove that a given financial transaction – as in the case of PIVX – is true to another party without conveying any information to the public apart from the fact that the money was indeed sent or received.  
  
Ahd finally PIVX will launch Zerocoin Protocol on the 16 of October.
These perfectly anonymous transactions will also still maintain the speed and security already inherent to PIVX.
