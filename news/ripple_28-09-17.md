## Summary
  
Ripple's Team announced opening of a new office in Singapore.
This decision was taken due to positive fintech and investent climate in Singapore that in future can be the world’s leading fintech and innovation hub.
It is also one of the biggest and busiest global trade centers with many large, multinational companies basing their regional treasury offices in the country.
  
Dilip Rao, managing director for Ripple APAC, said, “Singapore is leading the charge when it comes to streamlining money exchange, remittance and payments systems. In fact, one of the key themes raised during the Prime Minister’s recent National Day Rally was the importance of digitizing payments in the country’s aim to become a Smart Nation.
Our new office can support this ambition and equally brings us closer to our customer base across the Asia-Pacific region, enabling banks, payment providers and corporates to make instant payments into-and-out of the country using blockchain. As a leading trade and fintech hub, Singapore offers Ripple leverage in the region as we expand our global footprint.”
