### Project: [District0x](../projects/district0x.md)
### Date: 17 October 2017 
## Summary
  
In the last development update District0x's Team reported about progress taken on the [Name Bazaar district](namebazaar.io), which will be launched at the end of October.
Name Bazaar is a peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the Ethereum Name Service.
  
As mentioned above, District0x's Team spent most of the past weeks addressing the issues brought forth in the smart [contract audit for Name Bazaar](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/3416e5a85b5b67eb9cdfa2252a5e28d9).
Some of these issues were as simple as conforming to coding patterns enabled by the Byzantium Ethereum upgrade. Some are more complex styling and usability problems that we are tackling with future districts and d0xInfra in mind.
Some are simple garbage collection — making sure contracts clean up after themselves.
Other changes include a more efficient “New Offering” contract execution, which should reduce the amount of gas needed to create a sale offering of a name by roughly half.
Additionally, were introduced both error logging services and error handling, so that in future Team may detect (and quickly respond to) any unforeseen and untestable issues that may arise as the dApp takes on more names, users, devices and general traffic.
