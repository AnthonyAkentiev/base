### Date: 20 September 2017
## Summary
  
Red Pulse announced that the token sale has been rescheduled for October 8th.
The sale details remain the same as initially planned, with one notable exception regarding the NEO wallet required for participation. 
Red Pulse had previously released instructions on how to participate by sending NEO from the Neon wallet, whilst also informing users on Twitter than any wallet found on neo.org would be suitable.
Individuals must now use a new version of the NEO-GUI wallet that is being developed by NEO. An announcement will be made when the wallet is available for download and instructional video will be released.
