## Summary
  
IOTA team welcomes new member, Bartosz Kuśmierz.
Bartosz works as a researcher at Wroclaw Univesity of Science and Technology.
His background is in physical and economical systems simulations, and he hopes to bring this knowledge to the IOTA project.  
"Bartosz independently conducted very impressive research on the Tangle which automatically qualified him for a research position. As the project matures and adoption grows it is imperative that we optimize and learn as much about the Tangle’s properties in different environments and topologies, having great analytic minds like Bartosz working intensively alongside our other IOTA researchers and mathematicians is the key to building strong pillars underpinning IOTA and thus unlocking the true potential of the pioneering technology which it is.", says IOTA's founder David Sonstebo
