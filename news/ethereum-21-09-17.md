## Summary
68% of total Ethereum transaction value controlled by one system
 
The clusterization of all Ethereum addresses from the inception of Ethereum until 15.09.2017 revealed a class of addresses that we will call in this paper temporary. These are addresses where funds come and leave within a short time interval — no longer than 1 hour, after which the addresses are never used again. The temporary addresses constituted 46% of all active addresses and processed 65% of total transaction value during the analysed period. Analyzing transactions where these addresses were involved, we managed to collect piece by piece a full picture of what was going on. 
Of all transactions executed on the Ethereum blockchain during the analysed period, addresses with the incoming amounts of ~500, ~1000, ~2000, ~3000, ~5000 and ~10,000 ETH constitute 68.5% (260,1041,693.6 from 3,791,195,132.0 ETH) in money terms and 10.7% (6,216,314 from 58,035,623) in terms of numbers. The further analysis shows that these addresses are linked with each other and might be controlled by a single entity.  
The system seems to be first tested in 2016, and since the start of 2017 it came into active use. This might be explained by the increasing capitalization and liquidity of Ethereum. Most interesting is that an overall growth pattern of Ethereum transactions looks very differently when the Mixer share is excluded. If the Mixer transactions are left out of the analysis, it becomes evident that they contributed to most of the overall Ethereum transaction volume growth.  
Hypotheses
These are possible explanations for the detected activities we could come up with:
The protection offered to clients by crypto-exchanges: all clients’ funds are mixed so that the funds’ sources cannot be tracked and those holding clean money cannot be unjustifiably accused of any illegal activity
A mechanism set in place to protect U.S. residents who wish to avoid control from U.S. regulatory bodies
A mechanism used by a large private exchange to preserve the privacy of its clients; this exchange might be operating with fiat money
A mechanism used to securely transfer crypto-assets between crypto-exchanges
Any kind of Ether-laundering scheme
These are only hypotheses which we would like to discuss with anyone interested in our findings.
