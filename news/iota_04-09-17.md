## Summary
Dominik Schiener, IOTA's founder, had commented Chinaâ€™s Central Bank decision to ban the ICOs:
  
"Why IOTA is not affected? We did our ICO years ago and it was a software sale. At its core, IOTA is a software protocol that can be used even without a token.
Leaving that aside - we are not a security / equity tokens / whatever - IOTA is a currency that is meant to be the backbone of all future settlement between machine (and humans).
We've always been very clear that we do not appreciate the over-the-top speculation that is happening in the crypto space.
We have always wanted to decouple ourselves from this space and will continue to do so with some of the upcoming announcements that we have planned."
