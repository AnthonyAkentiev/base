## Summary
  
UTrust team posted announcement about changing ICO date and ICO conditions  
  
"At UTRUST our main goal is to build the best blockchain payment platform in the world. In line with this, we take feedback from both, our community, and legal regulatory counsel, very seriously.
With this feedback in mind, we have decided to postpone the ICO date and to change the ICO structure in the interests of clarity and fairness to our investors.  
After careful consideration, we will no longer offer 7 rounds with different pricing levels. Instead, we will only offer 1 investment round at a fixed price of $0.065 per UTRUST token. A maximum of 50 Million U.S. Dollars will be collected over a maximum of 7 days, making this model end much faster than the original structure.
Also, due to regulatory and legal advice, the UTRUST public ICO date has been temporarily postponed and the new date will be announced in the first week of October, together with exciting new information regarding advisors and confirmed exchanges.
  
We thank you wholeheartedly for your support, and for believing in UTRUST!  
All the best,  
The UTRUST Team"
