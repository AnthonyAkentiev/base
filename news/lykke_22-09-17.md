## Summary
  
Ethereum Private Wallet feature was added in the most recent update of the Lykke Wallet application (iOS and Android).
The new feature enables users to control their external Ethereum private wallet with the Lykke Wallet app, or to create a new Ethereum private wallet.
The key for the new wallet is generated from the private key of the userâ€™s trading wallet. Users can also import any private key previously generated in any third-party ETH wallet app.
  
Previously, if users wanted to send ETH from the Lykke Wallet to an external exchange wallet address without smart contract support, they needed to use an external wallet as a buffer. The reason was that the current multisignature ETH trading wallet was based on a smart contract, and some exchanges do not accept transfers from a smart contract. Now users can transfer funds first to their private wallet and then to any exchange without limitations.
  
The new release of the Lykke Wallet also includes market order protection feature: the app shows the user a warning message when the estimated order price significantly differs from the current market price because of low liquidity.
