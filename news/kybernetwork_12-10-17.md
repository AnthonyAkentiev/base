### Date: 12 October 2017
## Summary

KyberNetwork's Team had published first progress update post-token sale:  
* Partnerships   
KyberNetwork segmented partnerships into 3 broad categories: (1) reserves; (2) traffic generators; and (3) research/protocol.
Reserves: the supply-side, which comprises of liquidity providers in the form of token minters, individuals and organizations with significant token holdings, and to a small extent Kyber Network’s own reserve.
Traffic generators: the demand-side, which generates transaction volume and drives traffic to Kyber Network. Traffic generators include wallet providers and service platforms that require crypto-asset conversion service.
Research/protocol: to substantiate further analysis and examination of the platform components, mainly to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of on-chain or cross-chain transactions. One of the more exciting protocol partnerships that KyberNetwork have now is a collaboration with dappbase.com on the implementation of Peace-Relay.  
* Development roadmap  
From second half of November onwards, KyberNetwork's Team will be releasing partnership updates intermittently to build up a strong support ecosystem for the platform, while continue our development work on the product front.
For the core platform and reserve components, Team can expect efforts and resources to be spent on optimizing price discovery and rebalancing (trading) strategies. Eventually, testing rounds will also incur actual capital in order to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies.  
  
Additionally KyberNetwork's Team presented update on the 2 major components of the exchange: Core Platform and Reserve.  
Core Platform updates:  
* Fixed several bugs and made several improvements to the MVP wallet’s logic  
* Designed a new wireframe for the wallet for desktop  
* Working on wireframe for the wallet on Android and iOS  
* Started work on data fetcher component for the reserve side  
* Increased head count, and we now have a total of 8 developers  
  
Reserve updates:  
* Prepared detailed specifications of required data  
* Concretized the road-map, architecture and started discussions on basic rebalancing strategies  
* Even though based primarily on the MVP contracts, the smart contracts for a functional reserve still requires several additions to enhance security features and tier pricing
