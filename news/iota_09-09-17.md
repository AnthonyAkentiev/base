## Summary
The IOTA price fell 15% following the revelation that the MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) had discovered “cryptographic vulnerabilities” in IOTA’s hashing function.
Although the IOTA developers dispute some aspects of the report and have already issued a patch to address the findings, the DCI post garnered a lot of attention on social media.
DCI Director Neha Narula explained the findings in a [Medium post](https://medium.com/@neha/cryptographic-vulnerabilities-in-iota-9a6a9ddc4367).
She says the DCI reviewed the IOTA source code in July and were concerned when they found that IOTA developers had invented their own hash function, which security researchers caution against.
Those potential “cryptographic vulnerabilities” were reviewed by IOTA's team and [fixed in August](https://blog.iota.org/upgrades-updates-d12145e381eb).  
Here is how [Jeremy Epstein, IOTA's advisor, replied to Neha Narula's post](https://medium.com/@jer979/disclosure-im-an-advisor-to-iota-4956de37cfa0):     
"Neha — I applaud you for taking a serious look at an emerging technology and trying to find where it could have flaws, communicating that to the development team, and seeking to make it better.
However, I have to say that, in this era of ‘fake news,’ it’s very dangerous to have a title that implies there are vulnerabilities. It makes for good click bait, but as you point out in your post, they don’t exist anymore, which leads to an intra-post contradiction that, one might say, potentially undermines your credibility and calls your motives into question...
I think it’s also worth noting that, from what you are saying, the IOTA team responded quickly and patched the issue. AS for disagreement, they are certainly entitled to it, but they showed their objectivity in fixing what was clearly an issue…I would think that is worth some note."
