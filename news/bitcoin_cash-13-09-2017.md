WebMoney supporting Bitcoin Cash
### Project: [](../projects/bitcoin_cash.md)
### Date: 13 September 2017
## Summary
The biggest news of the week comes in the form of WebMoney supporting Bitcoin Cash. This is a rather sudden and remarkable decision by the Russian online payment service provider. The company recently enabled support for Bitcoin as well, which was considered to be highly controversial at the time. Russia has quite an interesting – and somewhat adversarial – relationship with cryptocurrency, which continues to deteriorate or improve seemingly without warning.

Now that WebMoney supports Bitcoin Cash, things will become more interesting moving forward. Users can top up their WebMoney balances with Bitcoin Cash, but they can also use WMR and WMZ to buy Bitcoin Cash too. It is unclear whether any merchants relying on WebMoney will benefit from this BCH support moving forward, though. All things considered, this was a powerful decision by the Russian company which may elevate BCH to the next level over the coming months.
