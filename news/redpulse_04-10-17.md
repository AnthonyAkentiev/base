## Summary
  
To participate in the RPX token sale on October 8th, investors must use the ‘Special Version for Red Pulse’ version of the NEO-GUI that is now available for download [here](https://neo.org/download).
  
Red Pulse have released a guide on how to download, install and use the wallet, which can be found [here](https://coin.red-pulse.com/neo-gui-guide/).
The guide includes:  
* How to download and install the RPX NEO-GUI wallet  
* How to import your existing wallet  
* How to participate in the RPX sale  
* Options for Mac users  
  
For those who are wondering about Neon wallet compatibility, City of Zion are working hard to update Neon in time to support the RPX ICO. However, do not rely on Neon being ready for the token sale. All participants should plan to use the RPX NEO-GUI unless City of Zion or Red Pulse officially announce an updated version of Neon is available and compatible.
