## Summary
Lykke has added limit order capability to the Lykke Exchange.
A limit order is an offer set by the user to buy or sell an asset (coin) at a specific price. 
As soon as the limit order reaches the market price, the Lykke Exchange executes order on the user's behalf — even if the user is not currently online.

“We are pleased to offer limit orders to the members of our community,” said Mikhail Nikulin, co-founder and CTO of Lykke.
“This feature has topped the wish list for many of our most passionate users, but before we could implement it correctly, we needed to make other enhancements to our exchange.
Limit orders are the first of many new developments to come from our commitment to keep Lykke moving forward.”
