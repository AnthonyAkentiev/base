### Project: [NEO](../projects/neo.md)
### Date: 08 September 2017
## Summary
An updated road map on the Exodus site today revealed that NEO is in the “Planned” status for future support.  
Exodus is a desktop multi-asset crypto wallet that allows currency exchange via built in ShapeShift functionality.  
In order to be supported by Exodus, one of the criteria is that the asset must be available on ShapeShift.io. As NEO is not currently listed on ShapeShift, it is speculated that the platform will make it available for trading in the near future. There has been no official confirmation of this from ShapeShift themselves.
