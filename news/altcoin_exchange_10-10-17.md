## Summary
  
In the [Twitter post](https://twitter.com/altcoinexchnge/status/916778395551227904) Altcoin Exchange Team had reported about completion of the very first Ethereum <> Bitcoin atomic swap.
Atomic swaps allow two parties to transact between two blockchains in a trustless manner without counterparty risk. So far only a few altcoins have performed this function with bitcoin; including currencies like litecoin, decred, and vertcoin.
On October 7th the Altcoin Exchange development team processed a swap between both bitcoin and ethereum networks.
The Altcoin Exchange team transferred 0.12345 ETH for 0.12345 BTC using an on-chain open source process. Altcoin Exchange plans to launch the projectâ€™s Github repository
