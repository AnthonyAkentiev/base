## Summary
Yale economics professor Robert Shiller won the Nobel prize for his work on bubbles. In his latest book titled ‘Irrational Exuberance’, he uses Bitcoin as an example of a market that has spiked and collapsed.

Shiller is credited with developing the identifying tools that are considered vital in picking apart frothy markets and discovering those in a bubble. He helped create indexes for measuring real estate prices and his stock market valuation indicator, the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio.

Asked about a real world example that would typify irrational exuberance or a speculative bubble today, Shiller’s answer was straightforward and simple: Bitcoin.
