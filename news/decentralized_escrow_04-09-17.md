DES allows, by majority voting, to determine the further financing of the project, which previously distributed the stages of receiving tranches for the idea implementation. As we understand, it is impossible instantly to write a program code, create a working model and a profitable business, the stages of its implementation are divided in time and take at least six months, or even more. Therefore, creation of Roadmap and phased financing is normal and realistic practice, without its presence, it is possible to question the project viability and Startup desire to spend raising funds as per its intended purpose.  
Each stage of the project includes the necessary work, which Startup undertakes to perform by the certain date and provide them to the investors' court for the next financing round. DES consists of voting mechanism, where the decision is made by the majority (more than 51%) of direct campaign participants, project investors according to the number of shareholding.
