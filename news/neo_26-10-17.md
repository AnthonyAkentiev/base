## Summary
  
New South Korean exchange [UPbit](https://upbit.com/) has begun trading in open beta. UPbit is operated by South Korean fintech company Dunamu, who also owns Kakao Stock and Kakao Talk, which is the number one smartphone messenger app in Korea.
Through a partnership with Bittrex, UPbit has opened 115 altcoin markets, including NEO/BTC, NEO/ETH and NEO/USDT trading pairs. A NEO/KRW market will be opened soon.
UPbit is the second Korean exchange to list NEO.
  
Most cryptocurrency exchanges in Korea only list roughly a dozen currencies. Bithumb, Koreaâ€™s largest exchange platform only handles nine. The launch of UPbit offers the Korean market access to a whole new range of cryptocurrencies.
