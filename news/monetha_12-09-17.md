### Project: [Monetha](../projects/monetha.md)
### Date: 12 Septamber 2017 
## Summary
  
Monetha's team had published new weekly review which is created to spread a word about the project and its development. As it was stated, at the moment Monetha’s team is split into two camps. One camp is developing partnerships with exchanges from the business side,
and the other side of the camp is working hard on the development of the product, and hiring the top-notch developers for us to develop the product of Monetha:
“At the moment, this is for us, the main focus is exchanges and developers, developers, developers.”  
Curently Monetha's tokens are only listed on a peer-to-peer Etherdelta, which is not a partner of Monetha. Hovewer, Monetha's team promised to onboard the major exchanges in the four weeks after the ICO.
