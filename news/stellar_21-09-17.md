## Summary
  
The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) and the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology (LHoFT) have coauthored and published a 40-page white paper on initial coin offerings (ICO).
The paper presents in-depth research and analysis in four areas:  
* the technical elements of ICOs  
* the use-cases, benefits, and risks of ICOs  
* recommended and forecasted regulatory actions  
* global regulatory developments  
  
The paper combines both a regulatorâ€™s perspective (per LHoFT) and a technical and economic perspective (per SDF).
The purpose of this paper is to educate industry leaders, lawyers, policymakers, academics, and the general public on the characteristics, use-cases, and regulatory concerns of ICOs.
