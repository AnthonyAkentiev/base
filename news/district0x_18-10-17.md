### Project: [District0x](../projects/district0x.md)
### Date: 18 October 2017
## Summary
  
With the launch of Name Bazaar just around the corner, the District0x Team has been working to finalize everything to ensure a smooth and successful launch.
And in order for Name Bazaar users to be able to purchase their first name, there must be names for sale!
With this in mind, District0x Team introduced a community driven contest to pre-populate the Name Bazaar with quality names for auction and instant purchase.
  
Contestants need to render a complete list of names intend to sell and send the list to District0x Team. The team will assess all submissions and pick a few winners based on the quantity and quality of names made available.
Submissions with funny, creative, or highly demanded domain names are most welcome!
Winning submissions will be given permissions to list their names on Name Bazaar ahead of the launch. Additionally, we will be granting 5 winning submissions a 10,000 DNT bounty for ensuring a launch that packs a punch!
