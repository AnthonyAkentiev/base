## Summary
The difficulty for mining the second leading in the cryptocurrency pack – Ethereum has just jumped upwards as it never did before.

In the event that you are mining Ethererum, there is a chance of notice that the difficulty has just surged to its highest territory ever – as it is hovering right now at an unimaginably 3TH. This is a ‘game changer’ as it obviously push out many miners.

A similar but yet minor difficulty increase happened in July as it climbed from 1.25TH to 1.75TH. However, from 2.3TH to 3TH did the mining Diff increase only in 24 hours.

Rolling back to historical data, Ethereum to be mined in June had a difficulty of 1TH since then its rise was painful but stable. The increase did play out many miners that are relevant minor and small in the network. Lets wait how it will continue and how profitable will mining be in the future.
