## Summary
  
To unlock ICX tokens received from Pre-sale all investors of the ICON project need to follow KYC process.
The ICON KYC process will begin on Monday Oct. 23, 2017 at 13:00 (KST/UTC+9)and be open for submission for 3 weeks. 
To proceed with the KYC process investors need to:
* Complete KYC application form on ICON official website  
* Fill in personal data and upload Government-Issued Photo ID onto the Application Form  
  
In order to protect ICON contributors from illegal parties, the ICON team has partnered with a Singapore based Fintech company, Cynopsis Solutions.
Cynopsis Solutions is a KYC specialized company that provided KYC services for various blockchain projects.
After the KYC Application Submission close, the received KYC data is run through Cynopsis Solutionâ€™s Artemis AML (Anti-Money-Laundering) algorithm to ensure security, and the safe distribution of ICX.
The AML filtering will take additional 2 weeks after KYC Submission Period to be fully processed. The expected KYC process completion(submission & review) is in late November.
