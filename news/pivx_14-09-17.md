## Summary
  
Latest post on the PIVX Blog unfolds core value of PIVX cryptocurrency: PRIVACY.
As it's stated in the article PIVX has three pillars of Privacy:  
* Private Identity  
PIVX transactions don’t contain personal identity and location identifiable information.  Your identity remains secure & private when transacting with PIVX
* Private Network  
PIVX supports running on TOR & VPN networks allowing IP address anonymity.  There are a handful of cryptocurrencies that support this, however, it by itself doesn’t ensure full PRIVACY.
* Private Transactions  
The soon to be released ZEROCOIN PROTOCOL will enable you to achieve a truly untraceable end to end transaction, the FIRST in a proof of stake cryptocurrency.
  
The latest statement is very interesting because currently only [Zcoin](../projects/zcoin.md) is built on top of Zerocoin Protocol.
