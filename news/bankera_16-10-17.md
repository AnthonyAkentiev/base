### Project: [Bankera](../projects/bankera.md)
### Date: 16 October 2017
## Summary
  
In latest blog post Bankera's Team bring the latest updates about the project:  
* launched IBAN’s for both: individuals and companies. Thus, just like in banks, clients can now make fast and secure transfers in the European Economic Area.  
* launched cryptocurrency powered cards. Unlike the previous pre-paid debit cards that required the users to pre-fund their cards before POS/cashing-out, the debit cards are now linked directly to the user’s active cryptocurrency wallet at all times and allow spending and cashing out cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ether or Dash seamlessly in your everyday life. Currently, these cards are only available to customers who reside at the European territory, however, we are developing a worldwide solution for our clients.  
* welcomed seven new team members in the IT, marketing and support departments which will help us to prepare more efficiently for the upcoming ICO.  
  
To match some of the development phase completion dates Bankera's team has adjusted the ICO date. As a result, the ICO will take place at the end of November.
During the ICO 7.5 Billion tokens will be available for sale at the price of 0.017 EUR per token with soft caps of 0.001 EUR after each billion tokens sold. The sale will take place on SpectroCoin.
