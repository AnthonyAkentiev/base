### Project: [District0x Network](../projects/district0x.md)
### Date: 12 October 2017
## Summary
  
As part of District0x Network Transparency Policy, designed to provide project supporters with an open view into our inner workings, District0x Team have committed to publishing a quarterly report which provides an overview of project activity and a glimpse into financials every 3 months.
District0x Q3 Report covers following topics:  
* Mission, Vision and Values  
During the most recent quarter, the district0x team took time to define the mission, vision, and values that drive the project and guide our decision making processes.  
* Product development  
The district0x team makes use of an open proposal system to source ideas for new marketplaces from our community. Before the completion of Contribution Period v0.1, the district0x Voting dApp was deployed, providing DNT holders with the ability to signal for
what districts they would like to see built and launched to the network next as soon as tokens were distributed following completion of the fundraiser.  
* Partnerships  
The district0x team spends a considerable amount of time engaging with other projects (Aragon, 0x, Decentraland, SpankChain, Status) in the space who offer the potential for interoperability or who are logical candidates to
build a marketplace component of their project on the district0x Network.
* Community  
The District0x Network is an open cooperative and very much a community-driven effort. The project roadmap is not considered complete until all decision-making powers have
been turned over to token holders. Given such, attracting and maintaining an engaged community of supporters is key to the success of the district0x Network.
* Team
The district0x team has grown considerably over the past three months, expanding from a team of 2 to 7 team members at present. The following team members have joined in recent months.
* Financials
District0x Network declared $13 465 421 Gross profit in Q3 2017
