## Summary
  
Byzantium, the first half of the Metropolis upgrade on the Ethereum network, is now live.
This announcement was posted by Vitalik Buterin via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/910168926964690944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fethereum-upgrade-byzantium-is-live-verifies-first-zk-snark-proof).
The Byzantium upgrade will provide a more scalable framework for increased Ethereum transaction volumes.
In the same post, Vitalik notes that Byzantium verified its first zk-snark proof. The statement indicates that the potential for zero-knowledge proofs is real. Zero-knowledge cryptography is used as a method for verifying a ledger entry without revealing the identity of any parties.
