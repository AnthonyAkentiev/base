### Date: 19 September 2017
## Summary
  
Zcoin's Team had announced that v0.13 Core is finally launched.
v0.13 Core improves Zcoinâ€™s performance, network reliability and feature set. The codebase has undergone huge changes and represents a strong foundation to build all improvements on including Znodes and Zerocoin improvements.
Key highlights of the Core Upgrade:
* A fresh sync used to take several days and has been brought down to 2-3 hours  
* Full TOR support with hidden services and TOR stream isolation. With TOR stream isolation,  every outgoing connection will (potentially) go through a different exit node. That significantly reduces the chance to get unlucky and pick a single exit node that is either malicious, or widely banned from the P2P network. This improves connection reliability as well as privacy, especially for the initial connections  
* Greatly improved node connectivity, reliability and communication between nodes  
* Pruned blocks support allows you to only keep a much smaller set of data taking up only a fraction of space on your hard disk  
* Improved transaction fee system that will dynamically adjust fee where required  
* Allows much easier integration with hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger of which work is in progress  
* Zerocoin mints and spends are more reliable
