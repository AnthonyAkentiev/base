### Project: [District0x Network](../projects/district0x.md)
### Date: 26 October 2017
## Summary

District0x Team launched [Name Bazaar](https://namebazaar.io/), a peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).
Name Bazaar provides the ability for any user with a registered ENS name to list their names for sale, generating unique smart contracts that allow transfer of ownership of their names to a new Ethereum address and owner,
receiving an ETH payment in return. Likewise, any user with ETH (and soon, any token) looking to acquire ENS names can do so through these contracts.
Also, users can request certain names be listed, and track the status of any name on the website.
  
Work on Name Bazaar began immediately upon the close of District0x Network fundraiser in August, and this release represents the culmination of many hours of effort from all district0x team members.
