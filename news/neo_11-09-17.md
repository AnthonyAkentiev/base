## Summary
  
NEO Council had reported about possible phishing paper wallet generator. As it is stated by the NEO Council in the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6zd2p1/possible_phishing_paper_wallet_generator_under/):  
"We have received a report of lost NEO after using an online paper wallet generator (https://neop*****allet.org/).
We are investigating phishing and want to avoid that any more people lose their NEO until we can confirm that this paper wallet is safe to use.
The website registrant company is hiding the website owner's identity so we cannot get in touch with the author"
