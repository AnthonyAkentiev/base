## Summary
Ripple Labs Inc and R3 Hondco LLC filed lawsuits against each other on Friday. The suit is in relation to Ripple’s attempted termination of a 2016 options contract that grants R3 the right to purchase up to 5 billion XRP tokens at $0.0085 USD each until September 2019.
Ripple Labs Has Counter Sued R3 Over Accusations of Failing to Live up to a Different Partnership Between the Two Companies.  
A representative of Ripple labs has stated that the company’s “filing is straightforward – R3 misrepresented their ability and intent to deliver on their commitments. Given XRP’s ~4000 percent increase over the course of the year, R3 suddenly wants to tap into the value of XRP, though the facts are clear that they did not earn any option based on our agreement.” R3 has stated that it “does not discuss the details of pending litigation. We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter.”
