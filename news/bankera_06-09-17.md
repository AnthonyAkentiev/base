## Summary
  
On the 5th of September Bankera has paid its first net transaction revenue share to Bankera token holders.
As it is the first week and due to high demand we had technical issues with SpectroCoin at the start of pre-ICO, Bankera team have decided to share 100% of net transactional revenues of SpectroCoin to Bankera token holders, instead of 20% (as it was decribed in the WhitePaper).  
During last week, SpectroCoin has generated a net transactional revenue of 85,219.66 EUR which is equal to 333.13 ETH.
At the end of last week Bankera had issued 1,911,843,761 BNK tokens during pre-ICO and distributed 57,031,859 BNK tokens as referral commission bonus or as bounties.  
Hence, there were 1,968,875,620 BNK tokens issued in total. As the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated 0.000000170212815659507 ETH per Banker.
