## Summary

Stellar announced partnership with IBM and KlickEx to develop a blockchain-based cross-border payments solution proven to significantly reduce transaction costs and increase transaction speeds.
This solution will help financial institutions and consumers eliminate inefficiencies and frustrations in current cross-border payment systems, including high fees, slow processing, error-prone transactions, and inefficient capital utilization.
  
Stellarâ€™s technology serves as the core backbone of this cross-border payments solution. The Stellar network enables frictionless, scalable, and virtually-free cross-border payment transactions, and has been proven to be able to securely process over 1,000 transactions per second with a billion unique user accounts.
